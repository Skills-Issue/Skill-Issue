Excerpt taking from Course Description <br>
>"In IS212 (Software Project Management), students will learn about modern frameworks and tools for software project management. In particular, students will gain hands-on experience with ‘scrum’ and several other agile techniques (e.g. test-driven development, AI-based pair programming, continuous integration) as they design and build the first release of a software system. Students will gain an appreciation for how these methods help to manage the inherent uncertainty of software projects, as well as how they ensure that developers work towards a common goal at a sustainable pace."
